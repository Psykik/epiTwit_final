"Interestingly my cousin tested negative for Covid at hospital. His wife and son had fever for a couple of days and recovered, but they didn’t test. So the cause of my cousin’s pneumonia remains unknown.  6/6"
"The same WeChat channel had an article on the covid situation in the rural villages. In the past 30 years lots of young ppl left rural areas for cities, their parents sometimes children were left behind. We are going to see loads of heartbreaking stories in the coming days. 5/6 https://t.co/ksFmnIjTWR"

"Only the covid map stops, the channel is still going."
"I have been followed “the covid map” by 丁香医生，a health channel on WeChat since Feb 2020. It allows to get notifications for selected cities. In the past two week no case info anymore, only info on sourcing RATs, medicines and masks etc. On28/12 it was officially stopped. END https://t.co/ZYlFJpFI9v"
Most ppl were unprepared for the 180-degree change of the covid policy. They don’t have access to covid RAT kits and no medicine for fever. 7/N
"Now at hospital gates some kind of triage system have been installed. Ppl with covid symptoms go to the designated fever clinics (发热门诊）,  but no covid tests are required for these who need other treatments. So no wonder hospitals are red zones now. 5/N"
"I don’t have access to any reliable sources about covid in Xi’An, only my own observations. All family members got some covid symptoms, only a few of them were confirmed by PCR. Most of them didn’t want to be tested at all. It’s understandable. They had enough swabs taken in 2022"
"@amarbayarm I make southern style ribs (Texas style)

Definitely first trim on a lot of that fat and skin. Then I marinate overnight in a mostly sugar dry rub. 

Then 3 hours in the oven uncovered at 135C.

"Look, 2022 has been a really tough year for China. We’ve lived through multiple lockdowns, closed borders, and now a huge tidal wave of Covid inventions. But at least we can rest assured that HE is always with us. Watching over us, judging. HE will never abandon us. https://t.co/FKuFeeEM9U"
"At the end of the day, most countries need Chinese travelers. And, the Covid wave is going to pass through China fairly quickly. Less than a month. These requirements for pre-boarding Covid tests will be eliminated soon. Hopefully same with vaccination requirements."
"I left Wellington on 19/12/2022 and arrived Shanghai on 20/12. Finally I made my way back to Xi’An after 8 days quarantine in Shanghai. To my friends and colleagues in NZ, I am doing OK and still test negative for Covid. https://t.co/Dgsv9fIpYy"

So sad :( Pray for all children who Covid infects in China.

"@Kgosietsile_012 Zero Covid policies have been lifted. There’s a surge in cases right now throughout the whole country. 

Basically, stage one of opening the country up"
Entlik how does Covid work?
"After the first wave of 🦠 after the opening, most people returned to a healthy state, some of my friends had fevers 🤒 and some just had throat discomfort🤧, I had no infection at all (or no symptoms) and at the same time I was notified to prepare to return to the office🥱#China https://t.co/wpGYz3jtMA"

@DuanQiaozhi @DreyerChina Yes I hope they can find a better way  as soon as possible.China earned 2 years’ time to prepare for ‘after-covid’ life without large amount of death due to their correct decision.But we didn’t make good use of the 2 year. China need a proper adjustment for us and the world
"@DuanQiaozhi @DreyerChina I love China as everybody else.China did a good job fighting Covid in 2021.But what happened in 2022 is really terrible.I can only complain things on Twitter, my WeChat was blocked yesterday.China is a great country, but making a big mistake right now."

@BFMTV Et la t’apprends à la télé qu’en #Chine ils ont 87% de #Covid asymptomatiques alors qu’ils ont jamais eu de #vaccin #pfizer ou #moderna ou autre piqûre #ARNm et ça interpelle même pas les journalistes qui déblatèrent tout ça
