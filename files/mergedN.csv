"I don’t have access to any reliable sources about covid in Xi’An, only my own observations. All family members got some covid symptoms, only a few of them were confirmed by PCR. Most of them didn’t want to be tested at all. It’s understandable. They had enough swabs taken in 2022",
"Look, 2022 has been a really tough year for China. We’ve lived through multiple lockdowns, closed borders, and now a huge tidal wave of Covid inventions. But at least we can rest assured that HE is always with us. Watching over us, judging. HE will never abandon us. https://t.co/FKuFeeEM9U",

@kodiakglr @Felicia00076632 Everything you've said are first person subjective claims made in anti vax Facebook groups. This is entirely anecdotal. I know hundreds of people who got the COVID vaccine and not one of them has had any problem whatsoever. This is why we have science to figure things out,
"China has rolled out the red carpet for foreign business officials, part of an effort to revive its economy after years of Covid lockdowns. 

Dozens of chief executives, including Tim Cook of Apple, flew to Beijing to attend last month’s China Development Forum.",

"An activist organisation pretending to be media lacks the necessary credentials to dispense medical advice. Their widespread advertising campaigns asserted ineffectiveness of vaccines, specifically in the context of Covid-19, which contradicts established scientific evidence.",

"@dirkopen @jonathanstea Except you ignore the fact that many studies have shown that the saftey of the vaccine has been proven and that the benefits far outweigh the risks not to mention you're more likley to get myocraditis from covid than from the vaccine.

@nzmrichards @radionz I dont really care anymore about the hysteria that some still have about covid. Its here. We have to live with it. Do what you think is right for you to protect yourself but you cant control an entire populace?,

@Felicia00076632 @homcrn_baker You live in an alternate reality where people have been injured by COVID vaccine. I don't know anyone who's been injured by vaccines and there is tons of data backing up my claims. Therefore I am not a good person based solely on your conspiratorial beliefs.,
@el_hinko @CalltoActivism And they stole tax dollars earmarked for COVID PPE to do it. Both of which are felonies. Why are they not in jail?,
Nigga think he the don dada cuz he invented covid,
@Rustofur @nzherald I figure that it's same story as Covid. Exaggeration &amp; bullshit. It's been a year or more since most NZrs have had a vaccination. Not great that they did have but I think the risks to their health have faded.,
"@Rustofur @stopvaccinating Complete bullshit. Same story as Covid run a scare campaign, try and force everyone to wear masks, pretend that you have a vaccine for it. Additionally inject malnourished soldiers &amp; kill them.",
"More evidence Paxlovid may help prevent ‘long COVID’ in (some) patients, this time looking at vaccinated people who were not hospitalised.
Patients over 18 years old, from December 2021-April 2022.",
"This nicely illustrates the high baseline issue - hospitalisations now only falling to as high as the *peak* of the Sept 2021 wave.

The hospitals constantly have many COVID-19 patients, even between waves.
