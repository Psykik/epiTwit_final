@DaveGuinnett @pearce_murray She delivered on child poverty. COVID affected outcomes but there‚Äôs a reduction &amp; it‚Äôs enshrined in law for all governments to follow.

@Moofyman69 I live here. A few trimmed clips of COVID safety press conferences are not changing reality which was chill as fuck. Stop falling for this charlatan.
@DrAnnaNZ @Jenene @NewshubNZ Agree. There is even discrepancy in the definition long covid e.g longer than 4 weeks or 12 weeks after infection. It's a minefield for misinterpretation and potential minimisation of the issue!
@Jenene @DrAnnaNZ @NewshubNZ You are a great advocate and have done so much to get people to recognise and accept long covid. I think this discussion brings out a need to have a clearer definition of the condition and that for many it will have long term consequences.
"@Jenene @NewshubNZ @DrAnnaNZ I agree but not enough effort is being put into informing people of how to reduce risks of poor outcomes if they get infected. That was my point.
So I totally agree with both of you and concerns about severe long covid but I feel the report was incomplete."
