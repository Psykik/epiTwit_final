@DuanQiaozhi @DreyerChina Yes I hope they can find a better way  as soon as possible.China earned 2 years’ time to prepare for ‘after-covid’ life without large amount of death due to their correct decision.But we didn’t make good use of the 2 year. China need a proper adjustment for us and the world
"@DuanQiaozhi @DreyerChina I love China as everybody else.China did a good job fighting Covid in 2021.But what happened in 2022 is really terrible.I can only complain things on Twitter, my WeChat was blocked yesterday.China is a great country, but making a big mistake right now."
